* Function Name  : VN_SPI_SetSS(unsigned char sensorID, bool LineState)
* Description    : This is a generic function that will set the SPI slave select
*                  line for the given sensor. This function needs to be added by
*                  the user with the logic specific to their hardware to perform
*                  the necessary actions to either raise or lower the slave
*                  select line for the given sensor.  If a multiplexer is used
*                  then the logic/communications neccessary to perform the
*                  actions should be placed here.                                        
* Input          : sensorID  -> The sensor to set the slave select line for.
*                : state -   -> The state to set the slave select to.
* Output         : None
* Return         : None

*                  out the SPI bus. The slave select line is controlled by the

/*******************************************************************************
* Function Name  : VN_Delay(unsigned long delay_uS)
* Description    : Delay the processor for deltaT time in microseconds.  The user
*                  needs to place the hardware specific code here necessary to 
*                  delay the processor for the time span given by delay_uS
*                  measured in micro seconds. This function doesn't need to be
*                  ultra precise. The only requirement on this function is that
*                  the processor is delayed a time NO LESS THAN 90% of the time 
*                  given by the variable delay_uS in microseconds. The minimum
*                  timespan that is used by the VectorNav library code is 50uS so
*                  the function call shouldn't affect the timing accuracy much.
*                  If you decide to modify this library or wish to have more
*                  precision on this delay function then you can comment out this
*                  function and replace it with an optimized macro instead. Many
*                  compilers have their own delay routines or macros so make sure
*                  you check your compiler documentation before attempting to
*                  write your own.
* Input          : delay_uS -> Time to delay the processor in microseconds
* Output         : None
* Return         : None
